# Word Splitter

Inspired by a classic programming interview question, this C# program will take an input string and split it into a string of space-seperated words from a dictionary. "Applepieplate" will for example split into "apple pie plate". I've implemented two versions of this program, one that uses a string array as a dictionary and one that uses a trie. The trie-based implementation will use less memory for larger dictionaries, but the array-based implementation is a bit simpler to understand.
